    <h2> Mission </h2>
    <p>To quote https://24hoursoflemons.com/:  
        “Racing shouldn’t just be for rich idiots. Racing should be for all idiots.”
         </p>
    <h2> Vission </h2>    
    <p>The NorCal Time Trial Series aspires to make the excitement of competitive 
    racing events on iconic Northern California racetracks available to all 
    enthusiasts without the costs or risks of wheel-to-wheel racing.
    </p> 
    <h2> General Information</h2>
    <p>The NorCal Time Trial Series will hold at least one event per month on a 
    track such as Sonoma Raceway, Thunderhill Raceway, or WeatherTech Raceway at 
    Laguna Seca. Full safety equipment is required, and your car must pass technical
    inspection before you can compete.
